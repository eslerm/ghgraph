//! Typed views of the GraphQL response documents in queries.rs — the parse
//! side of the discovery/hydration split. One parse type per document,
//! field-for-field; change a document and its type together.
//!
//! Invariants, and the mechanism carrying each:
//!
//!   * Type = selection, mechanically. Every struct is
//!     `deny_unknown_fields`, so a selection the type does not carry is a
//!     parse error (selection ⊆ type). In the other direction every field
//!     is required — including Option fields, which serde would otherwise
//!     treat as silently missing-tolerant: each nullable-but-always-selected
//!     field carries `deserialize_with = "nullable"`, which restores
//!     key-required (absent key = parse error, `null` = `None`), so a typed
//!     field the document stopped selecting is a parse error (type ⊆
//!     selection). The two deliberately missing-tolerant fields
//!     (`Author::database_id`, the `rate_limit` envelopes) are exactly the
//!     Option fields WITHOUT the marker, each justified where it stands.
//!     The captured fixtures (tests/fixtures/*.json, re-captured by
//!     tests/capture.rs running the real documents against live GitHub)
//!     witness the equality — a document/type drift cannot land silently.
//!     One caveat, accepted as a trade: these functions take an
//!     already-parsed `&Value`, and serde_json's Value collapses duplicate
//!     keys last-wins before the typed parse can reject them. The input
//!     source (GitHub's GraphQL serializer via gh) does not emit duplicate
//!     keys, and rejecting them would mean parsing typed structs from raw
//!     bytes, forfeiting the shared in-band rateLimit handling — revisit if
//!     the transport ever hands over bytes.
//!   * API text is plain data. Logins arrive as [`ApiLogin`] — stored as
//!     received, compared only via `identity::login_eq` /
//!     `AuthorPattern::matches` — never through `identity::Login`'s
//!     validating `Deserialize`, whose error message echoes its input under
//!     a license (config is the operator's own text) that API responses do
//!     not hold. `ApiLogin` deliberately implements no `Display`, so
//!     `format!`-interpolating one into a search term or an error message
//!     is a type error. The derived `Debug` remains a formatting route
//!     ({:?} prints the login); it is kept because the fixture and
//!     round-trip harnesses need legible diagnostics, and no shipped code
//!     formats a parse type — reweigh if one ever does.
//!   * `author` is `Option` everywhere. The GraphQL schema keeps every
//!     `author` field nullable, and a null author is ordinary, live data —
//!     the blanket-`From` counterexample recorded in error.rs. GitHub
//!     materializes a deleted user as the `ghost` User
//!     (tests/fixtures/hydrate_pr_ghost.json) rather than null, but
//!     `author: null` occurs in production for other causes (observed on
//!     legacy accounts converted to Organizations, e.g. rails/rails#2);
//!     `None` must stay an ordinary ingest value, never an error or a
//!     filter match.
//!   * Errors are shape-only. [`ParseError`] names the document, never the
//!     content: serde's own messages echo scalar values on type mismatch,
//!     and response text is third-party — it must not reach an error
//!     envelope. Classification (TRANSIENT retry vs quarantine vs INTERNAL)
//!     happens at the call site per the no-blanket-`From` rule; the fixtures
//!     and the re-capture harness are the diagnostic for a shape mismatch,
//!     not the error message.
//!   * API-owned enumerations stay raw strings (`state`,
//!     `authorAssociation`, `reviewDecision`, `__typename`). GitHub adds
//!     variants (MANNEQUIN did not always exist); a closed enum would turn
//!     each addition into a quarantine storm. The schema stores them raw and
//!     judgment lives with the judge: `identity::is_bot` for `__typename`,
//!     attention.rs for the rest. Reversed only by a consumer needing
//!     exhaustive matching at ingest — none exists, and judgment reads the
//!     archive, so none is expected.
//!   * Timestamps validate at ingest. Every DateTime field is
//!     `time::Rfc3339Utc` (validated inside a non-echoing `Deserialize`;
//!     time.rs), so a malformed timestamp is a loud parse error here and
//!     unrepresentable past this boundary — the watermark fold and the
//!     schema's lexicographic-order convention both rely on it. The Z-only
//!     grammar is safe because the documents select only `DateTime` scalars
//!     (UTC-normalized, Z-terminated); GitHub's non-normalized git-time
//!     scalar is a different type, `GitTimestamp`, which no document
//!     selects — that is the evidence boundary for Z-only.
//!
//! Nullability is the introspected schema's, not a guess — with one
//! deliberate narrowing, recorded here with its reversal condition. The
//! GraphQL convention makes every connection's `nodes` list and items
//! nullable so a failed sub-resolver can bubble to the nearest nullable
//! field instead of failing the whole query. Carried faithfully that is
//! `Option<Vec<Option<T>>>` on every connection, and every consumer drowns.
//! The line drawn instead:
//!
//!   * Search hits are `Vec<Option<DiscoveryHit>>` — item-level null is kept
//!     because search spans visibility domains and a masked item is a real
//!     production case; the discovery walk resolves a `None` hit to a
//!     defined outcome like any other id (counted and disclosed as
//!     health.masked_hits — sync.rs).
//!   * `reviewRequests`, `reviews`, and `closingIssuesReferences` are
//!     `Option<_>` — `None` means that connection's resolver failed and was
//!     masked (a null the schema permits on the first two by marking them
//!     nullable; on `reviews` the Option is defensive and uniform, a masked
//!     resolver reading the same way), so the hydrator treats it as
//!     truncation, never as empty (counted_complete, sync.rs).
//!   * Everything else parses strict. A null where this module is strict
//!     fails the one PR's parse, and the quarantine row (error_class
//!     'parse') is the disclosed, retried outcome — the correct failure
//!     unit, and also the detector: a quarantined PR that heals on retry is
//!     the evidence that would loosen that spot to Option.
//!
//! What this module never does: judge. No filtering (the bot/author skip is
//! the discovery walk's, on data carried here), no folding (`nameWithOwner`
//! is compared case-folded at the comparison site), no derived fields.
//! Parse carries; sync.rs decides.

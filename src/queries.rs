//! GraphQL documents. Design rules these encode:
//!
//!   * Discovery and hydration are split. Discovery finds ids cheaply;
//!     hydration fetches one item's full context by node id. Never page a
//!     whole repo's pullRequests connection — `updated:`-windowed search is
//!     what bounds a high-traffic monorepo's cold start by the lookback.
//!   * Discovery is `search()`, scope-dependent. Working: three qualifier
//!     flavors for the viewer, deduped by id — `involves:` does NOT cover
//!     review-requested and does not reliably cover reviewed-by — plus one
//!     `involves:` per tracked person (config.people); for tracked people
//!     the involves: gaps are accepted, since their pending review queue is
//!     not the operator's demand. Project: one unqualified PR search and one
//!     issue search; broader results, fewer queries.
//!   * Discovery selects each hit's author, so per-repo filters (bots,
//!     exclude_authors) skip excluded items before hydration — a filtered
//!     PR costs discovery only, never a hydration subprocess.
//!   * Every connection selects totalCount + pageInfo. Any hasNextPage on a
//!     hydration connection triggers a follow-up page query rooted at the
//!     node id; if follow-ups don't complete, the PR row is marked truncated.
//!     No silent caps.
//!   * Search results lag and re-sort live; the caller overlaps the watermark
//!     window (~10 min) and treats upserts as idempotent.
//!   * Every document has a 1:1 response parse type in parse.rs, and the two
//!     are pinned to each other mechanically (deny_unknown_fields both
//!     directions) and empirically (captured live fixtures, re-captured by
//!     tests/capture.rs running these consts verbatim). Change a document
//!     and its parse type together.

///     stays NULL, and attention's polarity contract degrades NULL/unknown
///     ordering OUT of ready_to_merge (attention.rs, which owns the skew
///     margin) — the bucket under-fills, it never lies.
///   * Every author selection in this hydration document carries __typename
///     (structural Bot detection at ingest, since sync --pr skips discovery)
///     plus databaseId via User/Bot fragments (NULL when neither fragment
///     matches — schema-possible for Mannequin; the Organization-author
///     case observed live nulls the whole actor instead). DISCOVERY fetches
///     only login + __typename: its results decide skip-or-hydrate and are
///     never stored, so databaseId there would be waste. databaseId is a
///     stable id captured now so identity matching could move off logins
///     (deferred; ROADMAP names the deciding evidence) — it is stored, not
///     yet consulted (matching is login-keyed, identity.rs). author is

///     data (deleted users render as the `ghost` User, but legacy accounts
///     converted to Organizations null the actor — observed on
///     rails/rails#2), ingested NULL, never an error or a filter match. All
///     scalars on nodes already traversed, so zero extra rate-limit points —
///     only a few response bytes.
///   * authorAssociation on every author-bearing node — the PR, its reviews,
///     comments, and linked issues — is the reliable external-vs-insider axis
///     (OWNER/MEMBER/CONTRIBUTOR/FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR/…), the triage filter
///     GitHub actually backs, unlike "service account", which has no API
///     signal (use exclude_authors). Reviews carry it too, so the
///     comments.kind='review' rows never leave author_assoc silently NULL.

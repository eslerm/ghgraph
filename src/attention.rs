//! Derived review state — the highest-value, most error-prone derivation in
//! the tool, encoded once here instead of re-derived (differently) by every
//! consumer prompt.
//!
//! effective_review_state per PR, from three raw signals:
//!   1. the opinionated reviews — per-reviewer APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED
//!      (stored as comments rows, kind='review', already latest-per-reviewer:
//!      ingest keeps only the latest verdict per reviewer and the sync sweeps
//!      the superseded rows — sync.rs ingestable_reviews. COMMENTED reviews
//!      are stored alongside as activity but carry no verdict here.)
//!   2. review_requests          — who is currently asked
//!   3. the push bounds          — Commit.pushedDate is deprecated upstream,
//!      so "did this review see the current head?" is answered by two stored
//!      bounds (DECIDED at queries.rs HYDRATE_PR, sync.rs OBSERVED):
//!        * prs.head_committed_at — server time; push ≥ commit, so a review
//!          older than it provably PREDATES the push (stale-side, no skew).
//!        * the observations head_sha flip row's observed_at — local time;
//!          the head was already current when we recorded the flip, so a
//!          review submitted after it (plus a skew margin, owned here)
//!          provably POSTDATES the push (fresh-side).
//!
//!      Between the bounds, ordering is UNKNOWN, and the polarity rule
//!      degrades unknown OUT of ready_to_merge — the bucket under-fills, it
//!      never lies. Two under-fills are structural and accepted, recorded
//!      here as the posture rather than papered over:
//!        * a PR approved before its first sync has no flip row, so its
//!          approval can never prove freshness (reads StaleApproval);
//!        * head_committed_at is author-controlled clock (an amended date
//!          travels with the oid), so a future-dated commit widens
//!          staleness.
//!
//!      Both err toward demanding a re-review — the cheap failure. The
//!      promoting evidence for either: a real operator's ready_to_merge
//!      starving on live archives with timestamps in hand (ROADMAP would
//!      then weigh storing first-seen-head time, a defined-writer schema
//!      step).
//!
//! reviewDecision (the raw API field) is stored but never trusted alone:
//! branch protection makes it read REVIEW_REQUIRED over a human approval, and
//! it mislabels PRs that were reviewed and then pushed to.
//!
//! `attention` output buckets, in fixed order ([`Bucket::ALL`]). The order
//! IS the priority: [`bucket`] places a PR in the FIRST bucket it qualifies
//! for and no other — one demand list, not four overlapping ones, and the
//! ordering is why (a new comment on an approved PR must read as "look
//! first", not "merge"). report.rs serializes the buckets as an ARRAY
//! because its sorted-key objects cannot carry this order.
//!   waiting_on_me   — review requested of viewer: a kind='user' request
//!                     matching the viewer by login_eq, or a kind='team'
//!                     request matching a declared config.teams name
//!                     (membership is declared, not verified — config.rs
//!                     records why the empty default surfaces no team
//!                     requests rather than all of them; a request of an
//!                     UNRECOGNIZED kind naming the viewer escalates —
//!                     shape drift must not drop a request). A request
//!                     reaching the viewer on their OWN PR is excluded:
//!                     an author cannot review their own PR, so a team
//!                     request there is a demand on the rest of the team
//!                     — the exclusion rests on [`login_eq`](author,
//!                     viewer), structural certainty, not uncertainty,
//!                     so it suppresses no demand addressed to the
//!                     viewer. Or an unresolved
//!                     thread on viewer's OWN PR whose last substantive
//!                     speaker is the other party ([`waiting_on`] == Me);
//!                     the same state on someone else's PR is a reply, not
//!                     a request, and falls through to they_replied.
//!   they_replied    — substantive activity by another HUMAN party since
//!                     the viewer's last, on PRs the viewer participates
//!                     in. Authorship is participation (it counts as
//!                     activity at the PR's created_at); minimized and
//!                     deleted comments are neither activity nor
//!                     participation, and neither is a Bot-typed author's
//!                     comment — a stale-bot warning or a CI summary
//!                     demands nothing — UNLESS the config names the bot
//!                     in reply_bots: a review bot the operator answers
//!                     daily is conversation, and the explicit list is
//!                     the honest tool (config.rs owns the default's
//!                     argument; the ambient population stays machinery).
//!                     The judgment is the structural
//!                     __typename, never a login pattern; an UNTYPED
//!                     author (NULL — ingested before the column existed
//!                     — or '', unresolvable at backfill: schema.sql)
//!                     fails OPEN as a human until re-hydration types it,
//!                     so uncertainty escalates here like everywhere
//!                     else. A third known narrowing joins the two above:
//!                     the exclusion — and its reply_bots opt-in — is
//!                     PR-seat only. A bot speaking LAST in a review
//!                     thread still flips waiting_on, listed or not
//!                     (ThreadComment carries no type). Promote it on the
//!                     first real bot thread-reply that fabricates a
//!                     demand, like the others.
//!                     An APPROVED review verdict is NOT a reply: it
//!                     demands nothing ready_to_merge doesn't already say,
//!                     and counting it would shunt every freshly-approved
//!                     PR into this bucket ahead of that one (priority
//!                     order) — starving ready_to_merge structurally. A
//!                     CHANGES_REQUESTED or COMMENTED review IS a reply
//!                     (ingest keeps COMMENTED reviews as activity rows —
//!                     sync.rs ingestable_reviews), and so does a review row
//!                     whose verdict is missing: only a PROVEN approval is
//!                     excluded, absence of a verdict fails open like
//!                     every other derivation input here. Two known
//!                     narrowings, PR-level recency and push-is-not-
//!                     activity (a head flip is an observation, not a
//!                     comment, and its stamp is local time — cross-clock
//!                     comparison is review_freshness's hard-won domain):
//!                     promote either on the first real demand it misses.
//!   ready_to_merge  — viewer's PRs, effectively approved, no unresolved
//!                     threads. Fail-closed, mechanically: draft (cannot
//!                     merge), truncated (threads may be missing — the
//!                     "complete data" precondition), or a stored
//!                     reviewDecision other than APPROVED (branch
//!                     protection saying "not yet" is never overridden;
//!                     the decision is distrusted alone, but distrust only
//!                     ever degrades OUT of this bucket) each disqualify.
//!   people_prs      — open PRs by config.people with no review from viewer
//!                     yet. The collaboration demand only: monitoring tracked
//!                     people is served by the archive (search, query,
//!                     observations), never by attention — attention is for
//!                     demands. Not drafts (the demand starts when the PR
//!                     asks for review — the needs_reviewer rule, applied
//!                     early), and never the viewer's own row (a
//!                     self-tracked viewer is config noise, not a
//!                     collaboration demand).
//!
//! The maintainer buckets (DESIGN.md, project scope) follow, gated on
//! `triage_scope`: a READ-time fact of the LOADED config — project scope
//! with `triage` enabled (config.rs owns the default and the
//! working-scope refusal) — computed by report.rs and carried in as a
//! structural signal, never the archive's stored fingerprint, so archive
//! contents cannot create a bucket, and the judgment (with its oracle)
//! still lives here. `triage: false` narrows the DEMAND surface only:
//! the whole-stream archive keeps project breadth for search, query, and
//! people; what turns off is the duty. For a config with no
//! triage-licensed repo the buckets are absent from output entirely, not
//! empty: an empty array is the "checked, nothing" disclosure, and no
//! maintainer sweep was asked for or performed (report.rs serializes;
//! the gate is [`Bucket::maintainer`]).
//!   needs_reviewer  — open, not draft, nobody asked (no review_requests
//!                     row at all — an undeclared team is still somebody)
//!                     and nobody has reviewed (any kind='review' row, any
//!                     verdict: a COMMENTED review is a reviewer already
//!                     engaging). The maintainer demand is "find this PR a
//!                     reviewer", so the viewer's own PRs qualify — at
//!                     project scope the viewer is the one who can assign.
//!                     Ordered after people_prs: a tracked person's
//!                     unreviewed PR is the operator's collaboration demand
//!                     first (one bucket per PR; the maintainer sweep
//!                     catches everyone else's).
//!   untriaged       — the one issue-shaped bucket. Open issue, no labels,
//!                     no assignees, no maintainer reply. Judged by
//!                     [`untriaged`] over [`IssueSignals`]; [`bucket`]
//!                     never returns it (a PR is not an issue; the oracle
//!                     test pins the impossibility). "Maintainer reply" is
//!                     structural — a non-deleted, non-minimized issue
//!                     comment whose author_assoc is proven affiliation
//!                     ([`is_maintainer_assoc`]): GitHub's own association
//!                     enum, never a judgment derived from text. Labels and
//!                     assignees are stored JSON read by
//!                     [`json_array_nonempty`]; NULL (a linked-cache or
//!                     masked-labels row that never witnessed them), an
//!                     empty array, and text that will not read as an array
//!                     all count as ABSENT — absence of proof of triage
//!                     keeps the demand standing. A stale fill-only row can
//!                     therefore over-fill this bucket; that is the
//!                     fail-open price, and the reversing evidence is a
//!                     real operator drowning in rows whose upstream issues
//!                     are in fact triaged.
//!
//! Bucket scope, all four operator buckets: state OPEN and not
//! upstream-deleted. A deleted
//! PR's demands died with it; a reply on a merged/closed PR is excluded as
//! out of the working set — the narrowing to reverse on the first real
//! demand it hides (the evidence would be an operator missing a post-merge
//! question). Drafts stay IN waiting_on_me and they_replied: a question on
//! a draft is a live demand. Truncated rows stay IN the demand buckets too
//! (fail-open — truncation flags a row, it never suppresses a demand) and
//! OUT of ready_to_merge (fail-closed), which is the polarity rule made
//! mechanical.

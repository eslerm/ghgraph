//! The sync pipeline.
//!
//! Shape: K worker threads (config.workers, default 3) pull repos from a
//! shared job list ordered by the scheduler (starved-first; see below), run
//! discovery + hydration through gh, and stream typed messages to the
//! single writer thread — the only thread that ever touches the write
//! connection.
//!
//! ```text
//!     workers ── sync_channel(16) ──▶ writer (owns the Connection)
//! ```
//!
//! Messages (see Msg): Page for intermediate rows; Done for one COMPLETED
//! discovery window — its rows, its quarantine records, and the watermark
//! advance in one message, one transaction, both-or-neither, so state cannot
//! lead data and a quarantined id is passed only by the record that
//! resurfaces it; Retries for quarantine-retry outcomes (outside any
//! window — their ids were already passed by the watermark that quarantined
//! them); Deferred when the rate-limit floor stops a stream, typed so the
//! summary never string-sniffs; Failed is recorded in the summary, never
//! carries a watermark, and holds the watermark at the last completed
//! window boundary. Windows are processed oldest-first and hydration
//! ascends by updatedAt, so the hydrated prefix is contiguous, a window
//! boundary is a sound checkpoint, two consecutive floor-deferred runs never
//! re-hydrate the same PR, and an item bumped mid-walk moves toward the
//! unvisited end — seen twice and deduped, never skipped.
//!
//! Invariants, in order of importance:
//!
//!   * The watermark is server-side time — max DISCOVERY-time updatedAt
//!     over the window's resolved ids — never the local clock (clock skew
//!     and search-index lag both lose updates otherwise), and never the
//!     hydration-time value, which an item touched between the two calls
//!     can carry past a closed window's right edge (the fold in
//!     walk_window carries the full argument). Queries overlap the
//!     watermark by ~10 minutes; upserts make the overlap free. The writer
//!     takes max(stored, offered), so a targeted backfill over old windows
//!     can never regress it.
//!
//!   * sync_state advances only on Done: state never leads data. This is also
//!     the entire cancellation story — SIGINT kills the process group (gh
//!     children included), SQLite rolls back the open transaction on next
//!     open, and the next run redoes the window. No signal handler, on
//!     purpose. (Data may lead state: Page rows commit before their window's
//!     watermark, which replay idempotence makes safe.)
//!
//!   * Mark-and-sweep applies soft deletes (deleted_at) to comments/threads
//!     absent from a COMPLETELY fetched connection — never from a truncated
//!     one, or truncation reads as deletion. Deleted rows are kept: upstream
//!     deletion is signal for a memory tool. Review rows (comments
//!     kind='review') sweep under the same rule against the ingested review
//!     set (ingestable_reviews: the latest opinionated verdict per reviewer
//!     plus every COMMENTED review). A row leaving that set was superseded by
//!     its reviewer's newer verdict, dismissed, or deleted upstream, and
//!     deleted_at uniformly means "left the observed set" — one sweep rule,
//!     not two.
//!
//!   * Upserts: ON CONFLICT(repo, number) for prs (node ids are data, not
//!     identity), ON CONFLICT(id) elsewhere; never INSERT OR REPLACE (rowid
//!     churn breaks FTS). The field diff each upsert computes is recorded to
//!     observations — that diff is the "what changed since yesterday" answer.
//!     EVERY write is diff-gated, children and wholesale-replaced sets
//!     included: replaying an unchanged remote writes no row, no
//!     observation, and no FTS churn, which is what makes a killed window's
//!     redo a no-op. The diff is load-bearing twice; it is never refactored
//!     to compute after the write.
//!
//!   * verified_at moves only when it says something new: it is stamped when
//!     the hydration was witness-complete AND (anything changed, or the row
//!     was truncated/never-verified, or the hydration was the re-verify
//!     tier's explicit refetch). An overlap-window re-hydration of an
//!     unchanged PR touches nothing — otherwise the ~10-minute overlap would
//!     rewrite a row per PR per run and replay idempotence would be a lie —
//!     while the re-verify tier's refetch always re-stamps, so its schedule
//!     (which reads verified_at) keeps advancing.
//!
//!   * Workers return control on every fallible path (no unwrap on external
//!     data); a panic is a ghgraph bug and crashes loudly. No catch_unwind.
//!
//!   * The writer's original Sender is dropped before the recv loop, or the
//!     loop never terminates.
//!
//!   * Every discovered id resolves to exactly one outcome — hydrated,
//!     filtered, quarantined, or deferred. The stream watermark is
//!     max(updatedAt) over hydrated ∪ filtered (filtered is declined, not
//!     unfetched — a bot-only window must still advance, or re-discovery
//!     grows without bound); a deferred id caps the watermark below it (a
//!     floor stop mid-window sends no Done); a quarantined id is passed only
//!     with its quarantine row in the same transaction. A masked search hit
//!     (item-level null: a visibility domain the viewer cannot see into)
//!     has no id and no updatedAt — it is counted and disclosed
//!     (health.masked_hits) as its defined outcome. An unsplittable window
//!     that still overflows the search cap records discovery_truncated,
//!     keeps what it saw as Page rows, and HALTS the stream, because any
//!     later window's Done would advance the watermark past the lost tail.
//!
//!   * Re-verify (tiered, or --full) gives a PR a complete refetch to catch
//!     quiet mutations — comment edits and deletions, thread resolves — that
//!     never bump updatedAt past the watermark: open PRs every
//!     reverify_open_days REGARDLESS of lookback (OPEN is the relevance
//!     signal, not recency — otherwise a quiet open PR closed upstream sits
//!     in waiting_on_me forever), closed/merged every reverify_closed_days
//!     within lookback of closed_at/merged_at. The schedule derives from
//!     state + verified_at.
//!
//!   * One scheduler function decides "hydrate this now?" and orders all
//!     work: quarantine backoff dominates every hydration cause (only an
//!     explicit --pr consumes a retry attempt through backoff); repos run
//!     starved-first (runs_since_advance desc, size desc as tiebreaker —
//!     largest-first retired to tiebreaker because it optimizes wall clock
//!     at the cost of "every repo eventually advances"); within a repo,
//!     discovery and new-activity hydration precede quarantine retries,
//!     which precede re-verify; re-verify is capped per run,
//!     oldest-verified_at first (never-verified rows lead), deterministically
//!     jittered (FNV-1a hash(repo, number) mod period — no RNG, golden
//!     summaries stay byte-stable), and sheds first at the floor, with shed
//!     volume counted (refresh.reverify_shed).
//!
//!   * verified_at is a witnessed write: set only in a transaction holding a
//!     completeness witness for EVERY connection of the PR, which also
//!     recomputes truncated = 0. A witness is constructible iff pagination
//!     of the connection's live id set terminated — ids suffice, bodies are
//!     not part of completeness — so a full skeleton walk earns witnesses
//!     and may sweep, a truncated hydration never stamps, and a
//!     witness-complete sync --pr does.
//!
//!   * Rehydration of a touched PR is LAYERED (the round-0-audited design;
//!     DESIGN.md's refresh section carries the argument): a
//!     discovery-origin rehydration of a PR with a witnessed baseline
//!     (verified_at set, truncated 0, not deleted — the structural,
//!     caller-side dispatch gate in StreamCtx::hydrate) fetches
//!     REFRESH_PR — the tail (comments last: K WITH totalCount, one
//!     document per page, a two-round-trip count/tail split being a
//!     TOCTOU) plus skeleton threads (cheap mutable fields, no bodies) —
//!     and runs the count-conservation check (tail_conservation, where
//!     the two masked cases and the fully-observed refinement are
//!     documented). Every arm that cannot license the skip escalates to
//!     the full walk, restarting from the top; every mid-walk abort
//!     (floor, transport) lands the bundle Incomplete instead. A tail hit
//!     is the third completeness state: it upserts the tail, resolves
//!     thread bodies from the archive when id + lastEditedAt match
//!     (bodies_skipped) or refetches whole changed threads
//!     (THREAD_BODIES), and carries stored truncated/verified_at forward
//!     untouched — the tail can never sweep COMMENTS and never stamps,
//!     while a complete skeleton walk in the same bundle still earns the
//!     thread sweeps (per-connection witnesses, as everywhere).
//!     Re-verify, retries, --pr,
//!     and first contact always FULL-WALK: the first-page document plus
//!     follow-up pages for both big connections, the
//!     strictly-more-complete form the refresh specializes — and
//!     re-verify's full walk is what catches the masked cases, within its
//!     tier-bounded reach (unconditional for OPEN; within lookback of
//!     closed_at/merged_at for CLOSED/MERGED — beyond that a masked case
//!     is permanently stale, the same accepted scope limit as closed-tier
//!     discovery). The enablement gate the audit demanded holds as a
//!     fixture: minimized comments COUNT in totalCount
//!     (tests/fixtures/comments_minimized.json; parse.rs pins it
//!     offline). One asymmetry, disclosed: a review thread whose comment
//!     count exceeds the full walk's nested first:30 stays truncated=1 on
//!     full-walk paths (counted, re-verified, never swept) until the
//!     nested `last: K` tail lands (ROADMAP defers sizing it to real
//!     totalCount data) — but the refresh path's per-thread refetch
//!     covers 50, so a thread that grows past 30 on an already-verified
//!     PR can still be completed by a refresh. A later full walk of that
//!     PR cannot re-witness the >30 thread (its stamp stalls and, when
//!     fields changed, it marks truncated) — conservative, disclosed,
//!     and retired by the nested tail when it lands.
//!
//!   * Rate-limit floor: every GraphQL document returns rateLimit cost and
//!     remaining; when remaining < config.rate_limit_floor, the run defers —
//!     per-repo "deferred at floor" in the summary, watermark unadvanced
//!     past unfetched data. Sync shares the point budget with the operator's
//!     interactive gh use and must never drain it. The floor state is a
//!     run-wide flag: one worker tripping it defers every repo behind it.
//!     A missing rateLimit envelope on a successful call yields no new
//!     budget information; the floor keeps its last observation and the
//!     call is counted (health.rate_limit_unknown) — deferring on a benign
//!     envelope hiccup would stall syncs on nothing, and true exhaustion
//!     still arrives typed (FailureKind::RateExhausted folds into this same
//!     defer path).
//!
//! Summary document: repos sorted by name, per-repo fields grouped —
//!
//! ```text
//!     counts   fetched, upserted, unchanged (diff-gate skips), filtered
//!              (bots / exclude_authors skips — configured absence is
//!              visible), observations, soft_deleted
//!     refresh  reverified, quiet_mutations_found, reverify_shed,
//!              tail_hits, full_walks (partitioning concluded refresh
//!              attempts — the hit rate that sizes TAIL_K), escalations
//!              (full_walks split by reason: which response would change
//!              the outcome is a per-reason question), bodies_skipped
//!     cost     subprocess_count, subprocess_seconds, bytes_parsed,
//!              rate_cost, sleeps, sleep_seconds
//!     health   truncated, quarantined, discovery_truncated,
//!              deferred_at_floor, watchdog_kills, masked_hits,
//!              rate_limit_unknown, errors
//! ```
//!
//! plus run-level rate remaining. Per-call overhead is the intercept of a
//! regression over the run's real (bytes_parsed, subprocess_seconds) pairs;
//! the batching decision reads a median over trailing sync_runs rows, never
//! one run. (A per-run calibration call was designed and cut by the
//! telemetry rule itself: the field's consumer has a superior zero-spend
//! source.) Deterministic modulo the enumerated timing fields
//! (subprocess_seconds, sleep_seconds), which golden tests mask.
//!
//! Telemetry rule: every field names the decision it feeds — batching (the
//! overhead intercept), re-verify tiers (quiet_mutations_found, makes the
//! defaults falsifiable), tail size (tail_hits vs full_walks, with their
//! mechanism), retry and floor defaults — or the regression it detects
//! (unchanged remote with nonzero deltas is replay idempotence failing
//! live; rate_limit_unknown is the envelope regressing). A field with no
//! consumer is deleted. Per-repo detail lives here only: sync_runs persists
//! one flat row per run and grows no child tables. The fence, precisely:
//! per-repo STATE with a scheduling consumer (runs_since_advance) is state
//! and lives on sync_state; per-repo HISTORY is telemetry and stays
//! ephemeral. runs_since_advance semantics, refined where the mechanism
//! landed: it resets when the stream COMPLETES (all windows Done — an
//! empty-but-checked repo is not starved) and increments on a deferred or
//! failed run; the starvation it detects is "never gets to finish", not
//! "finds nothing".
//!
//! The sync run lock: one OS file lock (`File::try_lock`, ghgraph.db.lock
//! beside the archive), released by the OS on any death including SIGKILL —
//! never a run-long transaction, which would destroy per-window commits. A
//! second sync exits promptly with a typed already-running envelope,
//! TRANSIENT: the actor who fixes it is time.

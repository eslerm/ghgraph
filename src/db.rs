//! Archive open + migrate.
//!
//! Two connection kinds, two types. `open_rw` returns [`RwArchive`]; `open_ro`
//! returns [`RoArchive`]. They are distinct types so a read verb cannot be
//! handed a writable connection, or a writer a read-only one — that mixup is a
//! compile error. That is the *only* guarantee the types give. Write-immunity
//! on the read path is entirely runtime: SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY *plus* PRAGMA
//! query_only=ON (belt and suspenders — the pragma also blocks ATTACH-based
//! writes). `RoArchive::conn` returns `&Connection`, whose `execute`/
//! `execute_batch` are still callable and simply fail at runtime; the type does
//! not withhold them. Do not mistake the wrapper for a compile-time write
//! guard.
//!
//! Write connection (exactly one, owned by the sync writer thread):
//! journal_mode=WAL, synchronous=NORMAL, busy_timeout=5000. WAL matters even
//! single-writer: read commands stay usable mid-sync. journal_mode is set
//! BEFORE the migration transaction — a WAL switch cannot happen inside one.
//!
//! Modes at creation, never a chmod-after: directories WE create are born 0700
//! (DirBuilderExt::mode), the db file 0600 (OpenOptionsExt::mode with
//! create_new). create_new is O_CREAT|O_EXCL, which fails on an existing
//! symlink, so first creation cannot be redirected through one. The reopen path
//! does NOT use SQLITE_OPEN_NOFOLLOW: that flag refuses a database whose path
//! merely *traverses* a symlinked directory (macOS's /var is one, so is many an
//! operator's data dir), turning a legitimate archive into a false refusal. The
//! symlink-swap threat on reopen is closed by the 0700 archive directory
//! instead — planting a symlink inside it requires write access an attacker only
//! has if they already own the operator. That same 0700 directory is the
//! confidentiality boundary for SQLite's -wal/-shm sidecars, created at the
//! process umask (we cannot set their mode at their creation without a libc dep
//! we do not take).
//!
//! Two preconditions of the mode guarantee, and their enforcement:
//!   * A pre-existing archive directory (an operator's custom `db_path`
//!     pointed at a shared dir) keeps its own mode — but open_rw REFUSES a
//!     group/other-WRITABLE parent unless it is root-owned AND sticky (the
//!     /tmp shape): a writable parent is exactly the access the symlink-swap
//!     defense assumes the attacker lacks; sticky denies NON-OWNERS the
//!     unlink+replace a swap needs, and the root-owned narrowing keeps a
//!     user-owned 1777 dir (whose owner retains both) refused. The residue
//!     sticky cannot cover — planting a symlink at a not-yet-existing
//!     archive path needs only create — is closed by an lstat refusal of a
//!     symlink at the path itself (refuse_symlink_archive). Immediate
//!     parent only, with the limit stated: a writable ANCESTOR can rename
//!     the parent dir itself aside and substitute one that passes every
//!     check here — the same unsafe-traversal exposure the module accepts
//!     by rejecting NOFOLLOW/openat chains, and an operator's path choice,
//!     not a mode this code can vet. Write bits only, decided: a
//!     world-READABLE parent weakens the -wal/-shm confidentiality
//!     boundary but forges nothing — refusing it would false-refuse every
//!     home directory more open than 0700, so readability stays the
//!     operator's call and integrity does not.
//!   * mode() is masked by the process umask, so 0700/0600 is a ceiling, not a
//!     floor. umask can only tighten, never loosen, so confidentiality is never
//!     regressed; an exotic umask that clears owner bits could make the archive
//!     unwritable, which surfaces as a CONFIGURATION open error. The tests
//!     re-exec themselves under `sh -c 'umask 0; ...'` to prove the explicit
//!     .mode() calls carry the guarantee rather than an inherited umask.
//!
//! Versioning: PRAGMA user_version. 0 → apply schema.sql (always the CURRENT
//! shape) → SCHEMA_VERSION, schema apply and the version bump in ONE
//! rusqlite-managed transaction, so a crash mid-apply rolls back to 0 and the
//! next open retries from clean — the archive is never half-initialized.
//! Every user_version value has a defined outcome (see `migrate`); a value
//! we do not understand is refused, never guessed, and pre-release stamps
//! are refused rather than migrated — the policy and its reversal point
//! (the first released binary) are recorded at SCHEMA_VERSION. No
//! schema_version table; the pragma is the record.

//! Read commands. Contract shared by every one of them:
//!
//!   * One JSON document with a `_meta` header (shape below). Keys serialize
//!     sorted (serde_json's default map; the `preserve_order` feature is
//!     deliberately absent) — sorted keys are the determinism contract, so
//!     turning that feature on would break every golden test, not just style.
//!   * Deterministic: every SELECT carries a total order (trailing unique
//!     id column breaks ties); FTS rank floats are never printed; identical
//!     archive state yields byte-identical documents modulo the enumerated
//!     timing fields (`generated_at`, `age_seconds` — the list golden tests
//!     mask, and the ONLY nondeterminism the contract allows). `stale` and
//!     `hint` are quantized functions of that same masked clock: they flip
//!     only when age crosses the 24h boundary between two runs, never
//!     independently of it, so a consumer masking the two enumerated fields
//!     must read a boundary flip as clock movement, not an archive change.
//!     CI runs reads under
//!     PRAGMA reverse_unordered_selects=ON to catch missing ORDER BYs
//!     (db.rs, the GHGRAPH_TEST_REVERSE_SELECTS hook).
//!   * Reads never touch the network and never fail stale: `_meta` freshness
//!     is advisory, in-band, and derives from sync_state.last_checked_at —
//!     never the watermark, which is discovery state and lags on quiet repos
//!     (DESIGN.md, command surface).
//!
//! ```text
//! "_meta": {
//!   "schema_version": 1,
//!   "generated_at": "...",
//!   "archive": [ { "repo", "config_pending", "fingerprint",
//!                  "streams": [ { "stream", "last_checked_at",
//!                                 "age_seconds", "stale" } ],
//!                  "hint"? } ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!   `schema_version` is the OUTPUT-CONTRACT version ([`CONTRACT_VERSION`]),
//!   not the archive's PRAGMA user_version (db.rs) — the archive migrates
//!   without the contract moving. `stale` is a per-stream boolean (age >
//!   24h, or never synced); `hint` appears alongside it with the remedy
//!   prose. In-band staleness is the defense against consumers trusting old
//!   data; there is no --max-age flag. `fingerprint` is the STORED discovery
//!   fingerprint — what produced the archive, never a live config echo,
//!   which would lie immediately after any config change — and
//!   `config_pending` says the loaded config would produce something else
//!   (sync.rs owns the fingerprint definition; this module only compares).
//!   Every emitted PR row carries its own `verified_at` and `truncated`:
//!   repo-level age cannot bound per-PR staleness under layered refresh.
//!   * Body-carrying fields always ride with provenance (`is_minimized`,
//!     `deleted_at`) and an elision marker: `body_elided` is a property of
//!     the REQUEST (--max-body-bytes), `truncated` of the ARCHIVE — never
//!     conflated. Untrusted text is data: bodies reach the document as JSON
//!     string values and nothing here interprets them.
//!   * List commands are flat arrays of records under one key, with
//!     disclosed totals: limits govern presentation, never derivation
//!     (attention.rs owns the polarity argument). `pr` is the exception:
//!     one nested document, because its job is full context in one call:
//!
//! ```text
//! { "_meta": ...,
//!   "pr": { repo, number, url, title, body, body_elided, author,
//!           author_assoc, state, draft, base_ref, head_ref, head_sha,
//!           created_at, updated_at, merged_at, closed_at, deleted_at,
//!           review_decision, effective_review_state, truncated, verified_at,
//!           reviews:  [ { reviewer, state, submitted_at, freshness } ],
//!           review_requests: [ { reviewer, kind } ],
//!           threads:  [ { id, path, line, resolved, outdated, waiting_on,
//!                         comments: [ ... ] } ],
//!           comments: [ { author, author_assoc, author_type, body, body_elided,
//!                         created_at, updated_at, is_minimized, deleted_at,
//!                         url } ],
//!           linked_issues: [ { repo, number, title, state, url, resolved } ],
//!           refs: [ { kind, source, repo, number, resolved } ] } }
//! ```
//!
//!   `waiting_on` ∈ "me" | "them" | null and `effective_review_state` /
//!   `reviews[].freshness` ("fresh" | "stale" | "unknown" — an explicit
//!   enum, never a nullable boolean; the unknown case must not be
//!   truth-testable by accident) are attention.rs derivations; this module
//!   only queries and serializes.
//!   `author_id` stays internal everywhere: identity plumbing, not a display
//!   field (ROADMAP, freeze batch). `head_committed_at` also stays internal:
//!   the derived staleness fields carry its meaning.
//!   * `attention` emits the buckets as an ARRAY — the one place key
//!     order matters (fixed order IS priority, attention.rs) and sorted-key
//!     objects cannot carry it:
//!
//! ```text
//! { "_meta": ...,
//!   "attention": [ { "bucket": "waiting_on_me" | "they_replied" |
//!                              "ready_to_merge" | "people_prs" |
//!                              "needs_reviewer" | "untriaged",
//!                    "total", "returned",
//!                    "prs": [ { repo, number, title, draft, author,
//!                               author_assoc, updated_at, url, truncated,
//!                               verified_at,
//!                               requested_via? threads_waiting?      (waiting_on_me)
//!                               last_other_activity_at?              (they_replied)
//!                               threads_unresolved? } ]              (people_prs)
//!                    "issues": [ { same minus draft } ] } ] }        (untriaged only)
//! ```
//!
//!   Rows are locators (search's argument), recency-ordered (updated_at
//!   DESC, tiebroken total by repo, number); every emitted bucket appears
//!   even when empty — an empty array IS the "checked, nothing"
//!   disclosure. The maintainer pair (needs_reviewer, untriaged) is
//!   emitted only when the loaded config has a triage-licensed repo
//!   (project scope with `triage` on), and is
//!   ABSENT otherwise — "checked, nothing" would claim a sweep the config
//!   never asked for (attention.rs owns the argument and the per-row
//!   triage_scope gate). untriaged rows are issues and ride under an
//!   "issues" key — same locator fields minus `draft`, which an issue does
//!   not have. Both additions are additive under schema_version 1: no
//!   pre-existing bucket, field, or ordering moved.
//!   `--fail-if-any` never reaches this module: main.rs derives the exit
//!   code from [`attention_has_demands`] over the emitted document, built
//!   with no flag in scope — gate flags change the exit code, never a
//!   byte of JSON, and the signature is the mechanism.
//!   * `search` regroups hits by their parent PR/issue: bm25 ranks from
//!     separate FTS indexes (prs_fts, comments_fts, issues_fts) are not
//!     comparable, so no cross-index rank exists to sort by, honest or
//!     otherwise. Groups order by recency (updated_at DESC — the meaningful
//!     axis for work memory), tiebroken to total by (repo, number, kind).
//!     Results are LOCATORS (repo#number + where it matched), not bodies:
//!     the `pr` verb is the context call. Rejected: emitting FTS snippets —
//!     snippet() output depends on tokenizer internals, couples goldens to
//!     the porter stemmer, and re-ships third-party text a locator already
//!     names; revisit if captured MCP sessions show a search→pr round trip
//!     dominating token budgets.
//!   * `query` runs arbitrary read-only SQL. "Cannot write" is carried by
//!     the file-layer read-only open plus query_only (db.rs) and by rusqlite
//!     itself refusing multi-statement text in `prepare`
//!     (Error::MultipleStatement) — one prepared statement per invocation is
//!     a stated precondition of that proof, so the refusal is load-bearing,
//!     not pedantry. SQL parameters are refused (SQLite silently NULLs
//!     unbound parameters — a silent surprise, not an error, so the gate is
//!     here). Values map losslessly: REAL prints via serde_json's shortest
//!     round-trip (the "no floats" determinism rule bans DERIVED floats like
//!     bm25 rank; a stored REAL is stable data — though no current column is
//!     REAL, `query` must represent what SQL can produce), non-UTF-8 TEXT
//!     and BLOB print as {"$blob": "<hex>"} rather than lossy-mangling
//!     (incompleteness is never silent), and NaN/±Inf (constructible in SQL,
//!     unstorable in JSON numbers) print as {"$real": "nan"|"inf"|"-inf"}.
